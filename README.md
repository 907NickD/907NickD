## Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nick, a Business Intelligence Analyst

www.linkedin.com/in/nick-dawson-287233342

Currently, Im working on a customer demographic based sales analysis for a food company to identify varying food trends among those demographics.

In 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst 4-month program. The curriculum covered data set ups on Google Sheets and SGL, and the visualization tools Tableau and Power BI. 

I'm looking to collaborate on any brand specific, demographic specific and overall sales specific projects within the sales and food/beverage industry.

Some fun facts about me:

    Ive worked for local distributors, representing some of the biggest beverages brands.
    I have traveled by car, through 40+ states; without parental, company or organizational assistance.
    Across my travels, I have met multiple celebrities and have driven some high end vehicles.
    My future goals, outsude the career field, are to rebuild a classic muscle car.
